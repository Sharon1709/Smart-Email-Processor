token.pickle will be created automatically


API Keys:

Get your Groq API key from Groq Console
Enter the key in the Streamlit sidebar



Running the Application
bashstreamlit run main.py
Navigate to http://localhost:8501 in your browser.
üìã Usage
Basic Workflow

Configure Settings: Enter Groq API key and configure team email addresses
Fetch Emails: Click "Fetch Emails" to retrieve recent Gmail messages
Select Email: Choose an email from the list to process
Process: Click "Process Email" to run the AI analysis
Review Results: View classification, routing decision, and generated responses
Send Response: For auto-responses, review and send if appropriate

Team Configuration
Configure email addresses for different teams in the Settings tab:

Support Team: Technical support inquiries
Sales Team: Sales and business inquiries
Management Team: Escalations and complex issues

Routing Logic
The system routes emails based on:

Auto-Response: Simple FAQ-type questions
Support Routing: Technical issues and support requests
Sales Routing: Sales inquiries and business development
Human Escalation: Complex issues requiring human intervention
Internal Routing: Internal company communications

Sales: Product inquiries, pricing questions, demos
Complaint: Customer complaints, service issues
Inquiry: General questions, information requests
Internal: Company communications, employee emails
Vendor: Supplier communications, business partnerships
Spam: Unwanted or promotional emails

Urgency Levels

High: Urgent issues requiring immediate attention
Medium: Standard priority items
Low: Non-urgent communications

Sender Relationships

Customer: Existing or potential customers
Vendor: Business partners and suppliers
Internal: Company employees
Unknown: Unidentified senders

üö® Error Handling
